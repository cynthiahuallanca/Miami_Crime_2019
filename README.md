When you think about going on vacation, have a good time and relax: you are describing Miami! 

Miami is one of the most touristic cities in the US, not only for the good weather and it's 249 sunny days per year (Regarding [Current Results
weather and science facts](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Florida/annual-days-of-sunshine.php)) but also for the beaches, parties and different outdoor activities that it offers.

So, being such a great attraction for tourists and moreover, nesting a quickly ascending population, the Government should have in one the top priorities the crime.   

Either you are thinking of living or going for vacations to Miami,

  <b>¿Have you ever wondered about how's the crime?</b>
</p> 

What if you could know if the crime will increase.. and what if you could find the zone that has less crime? ... The truth is that YOU CAN! 

The following project has the purpose of using Machine Learning to predict next months of crime in Miami area, based on jail-bookings from May 2015 up to June 2019, we will try to predict, by crime time, how will be the rate in July 2019. 

Along the development and towards the delivery, you'll see different techniques and tools to form and analyze the data, up to clear and informative visualizations that we hope will be useful for anyone that is wondering about crime, either the Police that it may want to know where and how a station should be, a family searching for a new safe place to live with kids or a tourist thinking on party.
